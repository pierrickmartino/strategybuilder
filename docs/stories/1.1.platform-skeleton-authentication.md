# Story 1.1: Platform Skeleton & Authentication

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up, authenticate, and land in a pre-configured workspace,
**so that** I can immediately begin exploring strategy building in a trustworthy environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo initialized with Next.js frontend, FastAPI API gateway, shared schema package, and CI lint/test pipeline.
2. Supabase (or equivalent) authentication integrated with email/password and OAuth, enforcing simulation-only consent checkbox.
3. Post-login redirect initializes a demo strategy workspace populated with sample blocks and educational callouts.
4. Audit logging captures auth events and workspace creation metadata.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Establish monorepo scaffold with Turborepo and package workspaces (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `apps/workers` folders with baseline Next.js 15, FastAPI, and Celery entries matching documented layout. (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
  - [x] Configure `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, shared `package.json`, and Python environment files so `pnpm turbo run dev --parallel` and Poetry installs follow the prescribed workflow. (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#development-commands]

  - [x] Emit Supabase `auth.audit_log_events` into Datadog and persist workspace creation entries via ComplianceEvent log. (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]
  - [x] Record workspace bootstrap metadata (user id, template id, timestamp) in Postgres with compliance hooks before completion response. (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
  - [x] Add Playwright/E2E hook to verify onboarding flow writes audit trail entries. (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e]
- [x] Add automated tests and validation suites (AC: 1,2,3,4)
  - [x] Write frontend component and integration tests that cover login flow, consent enforcement, and canvas bootstrap. (AC: 2,3) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend]
  - [x] Implement FastAPI unit/integration tests for auth dependency and workspace provisioning. (AC: 2,3,4) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend]
  - [x] Create seed data fixtures for Strategy graph and consent metadata alongside existing backend test fixtures directory. (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No prior stories completed; this story seeds the foundational implementation.

### Data Models
- Use `Strategy` and `StrategyVersion` tables to persist the demo workspace entities, respecting ownership and version relationships. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#strategy]
- Store initial user record synced from Supabase claims in the `users` table so downstream services can link workspace metadata. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#database-schema]

### API Specifications
- Expose authentication-protected workspace bootstrap endpoints under `/api/v1` alongside existing strategy routes to follow the documented REST shape. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#api-specification]
- Ensure FastAPI controllers live under `apps/api/src/api/routers` and use dependency injection per template for Supabase session verification. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#controller-template]

### Component Specifications
- Next.js experience layer is responsible for onboarding flows, dashboard shell, and Supabase session handling; integrate auth helpers at the layout boundary. [Source: architecture/components.md#nextjs-experience-layer]
- Implement FastAPI core service responsibilities for quota enforcement and workspace orchestration via dedicated services modules. [Source: architecture/components.md#fastapi-core-service]
- Maintain drag-and-drop canvas state via Zustand store hydration when seeding starter nodes for the demo strategy. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

### File Locations
- Place frontend routes and components under `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/` with the login flow residing in `(auth)/login`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- Backend routers should follow `apps/api/src/api/routers/strategies.py` pattern, with workspace bootstrap living in a dedicated router module. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#controllerroute-organization]
- Shared request/response types belong in `packages/shared` to keep API contracts consistent across services. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing Requirements
- Organize frontend unit tests under `apps/web/tests/unit` and integration flows under `apps/web/tests/integration`, covering login, consent, and canvas hydration. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend]
- Backend unit tests should live in `apps/api/tests/unit` with integration suites under `apps/api/tests/integration` to validate auth dependencies and workspace service behavior. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend]
- Add onboarding E2E coverage in `tests/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts` to confirm post-login redirect and audit integration. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e]

### Environment Configuration
- Configure Supabase, API base URL, and AWS credentials using the documented environment variable templates before running services. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#environment-configuration]

### Technical Constraints
- Follow documented tech stack: Next.js 15 with React Query/Zustand on frontend, FastAPI with SQLAlchemy/Pydantic backend, and Supabase Postgres with Redis orchestration. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack]
- Ensure authentication uses Supabase JWT flow, fetching app metadata and syncing roles before responding. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#auth-flow]
- Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies, sanitize inputs, and stream Supabase auth audit logs into Datadog per security requirements. [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]
- Keep all new routes and workers asynchronous and wrap external API calls with tracing per coding standards. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Guided onboarding and education surfaces live in the dedicated module, so coordinate copy for consent and callouts with UX while keeping implementations within that module. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#feature-modules]

### Testing
- Execute `pnpm turbo run test` for frontend suites and `poetry run pytest apps/api` for backend coverage as part of CI. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#development-commands]
- Include Playwright scenarios in `tests/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts` to validate the end-to-end login and workspace initialization flow. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e]
