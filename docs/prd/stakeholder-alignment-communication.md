# Stakeholder Alignment & Communication

## Stakeholder Roster
- **Product Management (John – PM):** Owns roadmap prioritization, KPI tracking, and alignment with founders.
- **Engineering Lead (TBD):** Guides feasibility, sequencing, and delivery commitments across services.
- **Design Lead (Sally – UX):** Oversees experience quality, accessibility compliance, and research synthesis.
- **Data/Quant Lead:** Protects data integrity, simulation accuracy, and reporting transparency.
- **Compliance Advisor:** Reviews disclosures, educator governance, and risk escalation policies.
- **Founders / Executive Sponsors:** Provide strategic guardrails, budget approval, and go-to-market alignment.

## Decision Cadence
- Weekly product/engineering/design triad reviews progress, resolves scope questions, and updates the risk register.
- Fortnightly stakeholder sync reports KPI movement, research learnings, and outstanding decisions requiring alignment.
- Monthly steering review with founders validates roadmap adjustments, monetization experiments, and compliance status.

## Communication Plan
- Centralize status, open issues, and research artifacts in the shared Notion workspace with written updates every Friday.
- Use `#blockbuilders-product` Slack channel for day-to-day coordination; critical incidents escalate to the on-call bridge within 30 minutes.
- Distribute sprint demos and beta KPI snapshots after each iteration, tagging stakeholders for required follow-ups.

## Approval Workflow
- MVP scope changes require PM + Engineering Lead + Founder approval before implementation.
- Compliance-sensitive copy or template governance updates must be signed off by the Compliance Advisor within two business days.
- Production releases demand confirmation from Product, Engineering, and Support that observability alerts and rollback plans are active.
