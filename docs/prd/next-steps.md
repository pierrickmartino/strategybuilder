# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Use the Blockbuilders PRD to shape interaction flows: focus on onboarding to first backtest, canvas usability for non-coders, and trust-building visualizations for backtest/paper-trade results. Highlight accessibility (WCAG AA) and progressive disclosure cues.

## Architect Prompt
Use the Blockbuilders PRD to design architecture for a Next.js + FastAPI monorepo with modular simulation services, TimescaleDB-backed data pipelines, and scalable worker infrastructure. Emphasize data quality safeguards, cost control guardrails, and compliance logging.
