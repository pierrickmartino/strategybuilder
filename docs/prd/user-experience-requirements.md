# User Experience Requirements

## Primary User Flows
1. **Guided Onboarding to First Backtest:** Welcome modal confirms compliance consent, walkthrough highlights canvas primitives, user loads a starter template, adjusts parameters, and triggers a backtest with contextual education and progress tracking.
2. **Canvas Composition & Validation:** Traders drag blocks from the library, connect nodes, and edit configurations in a side panel; inline validation badges surface missing inputs, incompatible connections, or quota breaches before execution.
3. **Backtest Review & Iteration:** Results view presents KPIs, charts, and trade logs with explainers; users duplicate strategies, compare against prior runs, and capture notes for future learning.
4. **Paper-Trading Scheduling & Monitoring:** Scheduler workflow selects cadence, exchanges, and capital allocation; confirmation modal reiterates simulation-only status, while dashboards surface ongoing performance, alerts, and acknowledgement workflows.
5. **Template Sharing & Governance (Premium/Educator):** Community leaders publish templates with metadata, manage duplication permissions, and monitor cohort activity through educator dashboards with at-a-glance status summaries.

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Provide explicit remediation steps when market data is stale or unavailable, including links to status updates.
- Present non-blocking warnings for performance-heavy strategies with the option to proceed or revise configuration.
- Handle failed backtests gracefully with retry guidance, surfaced logs, and suggested learning resources.
- Communicate freemium quota limits before execution, capture upgrade intent, and resume action post-purchase without losing context.
- Offer autosave/recovery for canvas edits to guard against browser refreshes or timeouts.

## Overall UX Vision
Create a confident, lab-like workspace that feels approachable for non-programmers yet powerful enough for aspiring quants. The experience should guide users from exploration to execution with progressive disclosure—starter templates, wizard-like onboarding, and contextual education keep early steps simple while advanced configuration remains discoverable as users grow.

## Interaction Paradigms
- Drag-and-drop composition on a node-based canvas with inline validation badges.
- Guided onboarding checklist that morphs into contextual hints and tooltips as users advance.
- Modal or side-panel editors for block configuration with live preview of resulting signals.
- Comparison dashboards using tabbed layouts and saved views for quick strategy benchmarking.
- Notification center aggregating backtest, paper-trade, and compliance messages.

## Accessibility & Device Coverage
Adopt WCAG 2.1 AA as baseline: maintain accessible color contrast, provide keyboard navigation for canvas interactions, offer text alternatives for visual charts, and ensure notifications are perceivable across modalities. Responsive layouts prioritize desktop and large tablets for full composition, while mobile web delivers read-only summaries and critical alerts during MVP.

## Branding & Tone
Anchor visuals in a modern “quant lab” aesthetic—clean dark-on-light palette with accent colors per block type, consistent iconography, and typography that conveys precision without intimidation. Microcopy should celebrate milestones, reinforce simulation-only positioning, and keep compliance statements visible without breaking flow.
