# Epic 4 Community Sharing & Monetization

**Epic Goal:** Strengthen growth loops and revenue by enabling sharing, collaboration, and premium entitlements while keeping compliance and governance tight.

## Story 4.1 Template Sharing & Governance
As a strategy author,
I want to publish and manage strategy templates,
so that others can clone, learn, and credit my work safely.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. 1: Template publishing flow captures metadata (description, tags, disclaimers) and review checklist.
2. 2: Consumers can clone templates with attribution preserved and optional educator annotations.
3. 3: Governance controls enforce moderation workflows and takedown requests.
4. 4: Activity logs track clones, edits, and compliance approvals.

## Story 4.2 Freemium Limits & Premium Entitlements
As a product owner,
I want to enforce plan limits and unlock premium features,
so that we monetize while keeping the free tier compelling.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. 1: Plan definitions specify quotas (strategies, backtests/day, paper runs) with usage tracking per account.
2. 2: Over-limit attempts prompt upgrade CTAs and gated functionality messaging.
3. 3: Premium activation via Stripe updates entitlements in near real-time and unlocks advanced analytics.
4. 4: Billing events and receipts are auditable and exportable for finance review.

## Story 4.3 Compliance & Trust Framework
As a compliance advisor,
I want safeguards and messaging controls,
so that the platform remains clearly simulation-only and regulator-friendly.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. 1: Compliance toolkit manages disclosure snippets and ensures they appear on onboarding, strategy views, and exports.
2. 2: Risk review workflow flags high-risk templates or anomalies for manual approval.
3. 3: Content moderation integrates with educator publishing to prevent financial advice claims.
4. 4: Trust & safety dashboard reports incidents, resolutions, and policy updates.
