# Problem Definition & Context

## Problem Statement
Retail crypto traders without coding expertise are locked out of algorithmic trading or forced into brittle, manual workflows that stitch together spreadsheets, TradingView scripts, and unvetted bots. The resulting strategies are slow to prototype, difficult to reproduce, and risky to trust with capital. Blockbuilders exists to remove that barrier by giving beginners a safeguarded environment where they can experiment quickly, learn systematically, and avoid the costly mistakes that come from launching untested ideas.

## Target Users & Personas
- **Retail Crypto Tinkerers (Primary):** Individuals aged 22–45 actively trading on exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken with portfolios under $25K. They crave systematic workflows without needing to write code, want trustworthy data, and value coaching that builds discipline.
- **Crypto Educators & Community Leaders (Secondary):** Influencers, newsletter writers, and cohort facilitators who teach trading concepts and need shareable templates, reproducible results, and light-touch governance for their communities.

## Problem Impact & Differentiation
- Manual experimentation today is error-prone, time-consuming, and erodes user confidence because results cannot be replicated easily.
- Existing SaaS bots still require scripting or feel opaque, pushing beginners back to spreadsheets and trial-and-error.
- Blockbuilders differentiates by coupling a drag-and-drop strategy canvas with institutional-grade data, inline education, and compliance guardrails so newcomers can achieve a “first win” within minutes.

## User Research & Insights
- **Completed to Date:** Founder discovery notes and secondary research confirm high intent for visual alternatives to Pine Script tooling and gaps in trustworthy paper-trading workflows.
- **In Progress:** Five user interviews (3 retail traders, 2 educators) and a competitive teardown of Trality, Kryll, and Composer are scheduled during Week 1 of Sprint 1; synthesis templates are prepared in Notion to capture pains, jobs, and trust signals.
- **Upcoming Deliverables:** Produce a distilled insight brief and persona updates within two business days of the final interview, then summarize competitive positioning deltas (pricing, onboarding friction, differentiating features) for roadmap prioritization.
