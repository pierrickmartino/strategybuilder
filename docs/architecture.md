# Blockbuilders Fullstack Architecture Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Blockbuilders, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project
N/A – greenfield project. We intentionally assemble a Turborepo monorepo combining a Next.js 15 App Router frontend with a FastAPI backend (as mandated by the PRD) so we can codify shared types, design tokens, and generated API clients while keeping services modular.

### Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| 2025-09-22 | v0.4 | Documented operational playbooks, responsibility ownership, and resilience cadences | Winston (Architect) |
| 2025-09-21 | v0.3 | Synced with PRD v1.4 & UI spec v0.2: added plan guardrails, notification center, and responsive/accessibility guidance | Winston (Architect) |
| 2025-09-21 | v0.2 | Supabase adoption for auth and managed Postgres | Codex (AI) |
| 2025-09-20 | v0.1 | Initial fullstack architecture synthesized from PRD + UI spec | Winston (Architect) |

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary
Blockbuilders adopts a composable hybrid: the user experience is delivered by Next.js 15 on Vercel Edge, while a containerized FastAPI core on AWS Fargate exposes REST APIs, orchestrates simulations, and enforces compliance. Long-running backtests and paper-trading loops execute asynchronously through Celery workers on AWS Batch backed by Redis Streams and Supabase Postgres hypertables (Timescale extension). Supabase supplies managed Postgres, row-level security, and JWT-based auth that both frontend guards (Zustand + middleware) and backend policy checks consume. Object storage in S3 retains strategy exports, audit packages, and simulation artifacts (with Supabase Storage handling avatars and lightweight uploads), and Datadog/Sentry instrumentation spans every component so anomalies surface within the five-minute NFR window. Plan guardrails surface consistently across tiers through shared quota services, while the notification center, compliance disclosures, and mobile read-only dashboards consume the same APIs to honor the refreshed UX specification. This architecture keeps first-win onboarding fast, makes results trustworthy, and scales into community sharing without sacrificing governance or accessibility.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice
**Option A – Vercel + Supabase + AWS workers (recommended):** Keeps Next.js on Vercel Edge while delegating auth, managed Postgres (Timescale + pgvector extensions), and lightweight storage to Supabase. AWS Fargate/Batch continue powering FastAPI and simulation workloads with minimal infrastructure drift.
**Option B – Fully AWS-managed stack:** Replace Supabase with Aurora PostgreSQL and Cognito. Reduces third-party dependencies but requires heavier IAM authoring and custom policy enforcement before we can ship.
**Option C – Render + Neon serverless Postgres:** Lowest barrier to entry yet lacks compliance guardrails, fine-grained observability, and battle-tested worker orchestration.

Proceeding with Option A pending stakeholder confirmation.

**Platform:** Vercel Edge + Supabase (managed Postgres/Auth) + AWS us-east-1 compute
**Key Services:** Vercel edge hosting, Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Row Level Security), AWS Fargate (FastAPI), AWS Batch + Celery workers, AWS ElastiCache for Redis Streams, Amazon S3, AWS EventBridge, Stripe
**Deployment Host and Regions:** Vercel global edge (routing to IAD) + Supabase us-east-1 project + AWS us-east-1 for backend, workers, and data

### Repository Structure
Monorepo managed by Turborepo + pnpm. `apps/web` hosts the Next.js frontend, `apps/api` the FastAPI service, `apps/workers` the Celery worker fleet, and `packages` holds shared TypeScript types, generated OpenAPI clients, design tokens, and lint configs. Terraform in `infrastructure/terraform` provisions AWS, and `infrastructure/vercel` captures edge config.

### Architectural Patterns
- Modular monorepo with shared contracts to prevent drift between UI and API.
- REST + async orchestration: synchronous CRUD, asynchronous Redis Streams + Celery for heavy simulations.
- Event-sourced compliance trail stored in Supabase Postgres (Timescale extension) and mirrored to S3 for tamper evidence.
- Progressive disclosure via a thin frontend service layer that aggregates backend responses to satisfy UI spec guardrails.
- Defense-in-depth security: Supabase JWT + row-level policies, signed Stripe and market-data webhooks, encrypted transport/storage everywhere.

#### Component Template
```typescript
import { memo } from 'react';
import { useStrategyCanvas } from '@/stores/canvas';
import { useValidation } from '@/hooks/useValidation';
import { CanvasNode } from '@/components/canvas/CanvasNode';

type StrategyCanvasProps = {
  strategyId: string;
  versionId: string;
};

export const StrategyCanvas = memo(function StrategyCanvas({ strategyId, versionId }: StrategyCanvasProps) {
  const graph = useStrategyCanvas(strategyId, versionId);
  const { issues, validate } = useValidation(strategyId, versionId);

  return (
    <section className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <header className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Strategy Canvas</h2>
        <button className="btn-primary" onClick={validate}>Validate</button>
      </header>
      <div className="canvas-grid">
        {graph.nodes.map((node) => (
          <CanvasNode key={node.id} node={node} issues={issues[node.id] ?? []} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
});
```

### Feature Modules
- **Onboarding & Education Hub:** Guided checklist, starter templates, and contextual education tiles that mirror the UX spec's progressive disclosure cues.
- **Strategy Canvas & Validation:** Drag-and-drop canvas, inline validation badges, and comparison table surfaces tied to shared Zustand stores.
- **Results & Insight Dashboards:** Backtest summaries, comparison hub, anomaly inspector, and insight engine panels with shared data loaders.
- **Paper Trading Scheduler & Alert Center:** Scheduling wizard, alert thresholds, notification inbox, and acknowledgement flows introduced in UI spec v0.2.
- **Plan & Billing Guardrails:** Plan usage banner, upgrade modals, and quota tooltips that surface before heavy actions to reinforce freemium boundaries.
- **Compliance & Disclosure Surfaces:** Disclosure banners, compliance checklists, and educator governance panes to keep messaging consistent across flows.

### State Management Architecture
#### State Structure
```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';
import { persist, devtools } from 'zustand/middleware';
import { StrategyGraph } from '@blockbuilders/shared/types';

type CanvasState = {
  graphs: Record<string, StrategyGraph>;
  setGraph: (versionId: string, graph: StrategyGraph) => void;
  updateNode: (versionId: string, nodeId: string, updates: Partial<StrategyGraph['nodes'][number]>) => void;
};

export const useStrategyCanvas = create<CanvasState>()(
  devtools(
    persist((set) => ({
      graphs: {},
      setGraph: (versionId, graph) => set((state) => ({ graphs: { ...state.graphs, [versionId]: graph } })),
      updateNode: (versionId, nodeId, updates) =>
        set((state) => {
          const graph = state.graphs[versionId];
          if (!graph) return state;
          const nodes = graph.nodes.map((node) =>
            node.id === nodeId ? { ...node, ...updates } : node
          );
          return { graphs: { ...state.graphs, [versionId]: { ...graph, nodes } } };
        }),
    }), { name: 'bb-canvas' })
  )
);
```

#### State Management Patterns
- Separate server state (React Query) from local canvas edits (Zustand) to avoid cache churn.
- Persist drafts locally to support offline tinkering; sync when validation is triggered.
- Emit validation events via Zustand listeners to provide immediate UX feedback.
- Mirror Supabase `app_metadata.roles` into store on login for consistent feature gating.
- Hydrate plan quotas and usage counters from React Query selectors so quota modals render before API calls.
- Maintain notification inbox state (unread counts, acknowledgements) independently to keep toasts and the notification center in sync.

### Routing Architecture
#### Route Organization
```text
app/
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── (auth)/login/page.tsx
├── (dashboard)/layout.tsx
├── (dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx
├── (dashboard)/strategies/page.tsx
├── (dashboard)/strategies/[strategyId]/page.tsx

├── (dashboard)/paper-trading/page.tsx
├── (dashboard)/account/plan/page.tsx
├── (dashboard)/educator/page.tsx
└── api/notifications/route.ts
```

#### Protected Route Pattern
```typescript
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export async function withRoleGuard(route: string, requiredRoles: string[], next: () => Promise<JSX.Element>) {
  const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies });
  const {
    data: { session },
  } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (!session?.user) {
    redirect(`/login?next=${route}`);
  }
  const roles = (session.user.app_metadata?.roles ?? []) as string[];
  if (!requiredRoles.some((role) => roles.includes(role))) {
    redirect('/403');
  }
  return next();
}
```

### Frontend Services Layer
#### API Client Setup
```typescript
import ky from 'ky';
import { createClientComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs';
import { ApiError } from '@blockbuilders/shared/errors';

const supabase = createClientComponentClient();

export const apiClient = ky.create({
  prefixUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL,
  hooks: {
    beforeRequest: [async (request) => {
      const {
        data: { session },
      } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
      const accessToken = session?.access_token;
      if (accessToken) {
        request.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${accessToken}`);
      }
    }],
    afterResponse: [(_request, _options, response) => {
      if (!response.ok) {
        return response.json().then((payload) => {
          throw ApiError.fromResponse(payload, response.status);
        });
      }
    }],
  },
});
```

#### Service Example
```typescript
import { apiClient } from './client';
import { StrategyInput, Strategy } from '@blockbuilders/shared/types';

export async function createStrategy(input: StrategyInput): Promise<Strategy> {
  return apiClient.post('strategies', { json: input }).json<Strategy>();
}
```

#### Guard Example
```typescript
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { ApiError } from '@blockbuilders/shared/errors';
import { PlanUsage } from '@blockbuilders/shared/types';

export function assertBacktestQuota(queryClient: ReturnType<typeof useQueryClient>) {
  const usage = queryClient.getQueryData<PlanUsage>(['planUsage', 'backtests']);
  if (!usage) return;
  if (usage.used >= usage.limit) {
    throw new ApiError('quota_exceeded', 'Upgrade to unlock more backtests today.', {
      metric: 'backtests',
      limit: usage.limit,
    });
  }
}
```

### Responsive & Accessibility Strategy
- Breakpoints mirror the UX spec: mobile (≤599px) surfaces read-only strategy cards, alert acknowledgements, and upgrade CTAs; tablet (600–1023px) unlocks simplified canvas editing; desktop and wide retain full drag-and-drop plus analytics panes.
- Side panels collapse into drawers on tablet/mobile, dashboards stack vertically with sticky KPI summaries, and notification toasts funnel into the persistent notification center entry point.
- High-contrast 2px focus rings, semantic headings, and chart summaries keep interfaces aligned with WCAG 2.1 AA, matching the front-end spec's accessibility guardrails.
- Canvas blocks expose ARIA labels, validation badges emit polite live-region updates, and animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` to support inclusive UX.

## Backend Architecture

### Service Architecture
#### Serverless Architecture
Not applicable; CPU-intensive simulations and compliance workflows favor containerized services with predictable runtime.

#### Traditional Server Architecture
##### Controller/Route Organization
```text
apps/api/src/
├── main.py

```

##### Controller Template
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, status
from typing import List
from app.schemas.strategy import StrategyCreate, StrategyResponse
from app.services.strategy_service import StrategyService
from app.dependencies import get_current_user

router = APIRouter(prefix='/strategies', tags=['strategies'])

@router.get('', response_model=List[StrategyResponse])
async def list_strategies(service: StrategyService = Depends()):
    return await service.list_strategies()

@router.post('', response_model=StrategyResponse, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def create_strategy(payload: StrategyCreate,
                          user=Depends(get_current_user),
                          service: StrategyService = Depends()):
    return await service.create_strategy(user=user, payload=payload)
```

### Database Architecture
#### Schema Design
See SQL DDL above. Migrations managed with Alembic, and Supabase Timescale extension retention policies compress raw metrics after 90 days while rolling up aggregates for dashboards.

#### Data Access Layer
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy import select
from app.models.strategy import StrategyModel
from app.schemas.strategy import StrategyResponse

class StrategyRepository:
    def __init__(self, session: AsyncSession):
        self.session = session

    async def list(self, owner_id: str | None = None) -> list[StrategyResponse]:
        stmt = select(StrategyModel).order_by(StrategyModel.created_at.desc())
        if owner_id:
            stmt = stmt.where(StrategyModel.owner_id == owner_id)
        result = await self.session.execute(stmt)
        return [StrategyResponse.model_validate(row) for row in result.scalars()]
```

### Quota Enforcement Service
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from app.repositories.plan_usage_repository import PlanUsageRepository
from app.schemas.errors import QuotaExceededError

class PlanUsageService:
    def __init__(self, repo: PlanUsageRepository):
        self.repo = repo

    async def assert_within_quota(self, user_id: str, metric: str) -> None:
        usage = await self.repo.get_active_window(user_id=user_id, metric=metric)
        if usage.used >= usage.limit:
            raise QuotaExceededError(metric=metric, limit=usage.limit)
        await self.repo.increment(user_id=user_id, metric=metric, at=datetime.now(timezone.utc))
```

### Authentication and Authorization
#### Auth Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant FE as Next.js App
  participant Supa as Supabase Auth
  participant API as FastAPI
  participant DB as Supabase Postgres
  U->>FE: Initiate login
  FE->>Supa: Exchange credentials (PKCE / magic link)
  Supa->>FE: Return session (access + refresh tokens)
  FE->>API: Invoke API with bearer token
  API->>Supa: Fetch latest app_metadata (service role)
  API->>DB: Sync user + roles if first login
  API-->>FE: Respond with role-aware payload
```

#### Middleware/Guards
```python
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from jose import jwt
from app.settings import settings
from app.repositories.user_repository import UserRepository

auth_scheme = HTTPBearer(auto_error=False)

async def get_current_user(token=Depends(auth_scheme), repo: UserRepository = Depends()):
    if token is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail='Missing bearer token')
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(
            token.credentials,
            settings.supabase_jwt_secret,
            algorithms=['HS256'],
            audience=settings.supabase_api_audience,
        )
    except jwt.JWTError as exc:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail='Invalid token') from exc
    return await repo.get_or_create_from_claims(payload)
```

### Environments
| Environment | Frontend URL | Backend URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Development | http://localhost:3000 | http://localhost:8000 | Local development |
| Staging | https://staging.blockbuilders.app | https://staging-api.blockbuilders.app | Pre-production verification |
| Production | https://blockbuilders.app | https://api.blockbuilders.app | Live environment |

### Operational Playbooks & Responsibilities
#### Third-Party Account Provisioning & Credential Management
- **Supabase (Owner: DevOps Lead)** – Provision projects per environment via Terraform modules under `infrastructure/terraform/supabase`, capture service keys in AWS Secrets Manager, and document read/write role mappings; rotate all non-user keys quarterly with tickets logged in the ops tracker.
- **AWS Core (Owner: DevOps Lead)** – Stand up IAM roles, networking, S3 buckets, and Batch/Fargate stacks through infrastructure code; enforce MFA on human break-glass accounts and schedule 90-day IAM access reviews.
- **Stripe (Owner: PM + Finance Partner)** – Request production keys after compliance checklist sign-off, store secrets in Vault/Supabase configuration tables, and automate webhook replay tests monthly; rotate restricted keys every 180 days.
- **Market Data Vendors (Owner: Data Engineering)** – Maintain primary (Kaiko) and secondary (Coin Metrics) credentials with onboarding steps, billing approvals, IP allowlists, and monitoring hooks; validate key health weekly and archive vendor contact history.
- Centralize detailed playbooks under `ops/playbooks/` with last-reviewed timestamps, escalation contacts, and Terraform state references so new contributors can execute without tribal knowledge.

#### Responsibility Matrix (Human vs. Automation)
| Task | Human Owner | Automation Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compliance disclosure reviews | Compliance Advisor (quarterly) | Content linting bots flag missing disclaimers in CI | Manual approval required before production deploys; bot posts checklist status to GitHub checks. |
| Credential rotation & audit | DevOps Lead (Supabase/AWS); PM (Stripe) | Secrets scanner watches repo/CI for leaks | Rotation calendar tracked in ops tracker with Slack reminders. |
| Backup validation & DR drills | DevOps Lead | Scheduled restore jobs verify snapshots automatically | Drill reports captured in reliability register with remediation tasks logged to Jira. |
| Customer support & incident comms | Support Lead + PM | Intercom auto-triage tags severity | Humans arbitrate escalation path; alerts mirrored to Slack incident channel. |
| Knowledge base & onboarding assets | PM + UX Writer | Docs pipeline lints Markdown, checks links | Weekly audit ensures onboarding, trust, and compliance artifacts stay current. |

#### Backup & Restore Execution Plan
- **Tooling:** Use Supabase managed Timescale snapshots and AWS Backup for S3 buckets; replicate encrypted copies to a separate AWS account for disaster recovery.
- **Cadence:** Run nightly incremental snapshots and weekly full database backups; archive application artifacts after every production deploy.
- **Validation:** Execute monthly restore drills into isolated staging namespaces, verifying schema migrations and application boot; log outcomes in `ops/playbooks/backup-restore.md`.
- **Monitoring:** Datadog monitors alert on missed backups, replication lag, or failed restores; compliance advisor receives quarterly summary exports.

#### Knowledge Transfer & Support Handoffs
- Produce Sprint 0 knowledge-transfer packet covering release workflow, rollback triggers, support escalation map, and on-call expectations; refresh after each beta iteration.
- Maintain beta operations log (incidents, root cause, follow-ups) and distribute summaries during fortnightly stakeholder syncs.
- Ensure support and compliance teams receive updated disclosures, onboarding copy, and FAQ assets at least 24 hours before deploy; host documentation in shared Notion with repository pointers.
- Deliver user-facing education suite (onboarding checklist copy, trust/compliance FAQ, tutorial videos) mapped to activation KPIs, with clear ownership and review cadence.

## Security and Performance

### Security Requirements
**Frontend:**
- CSP: default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors none; script-src 'self' vercel.dev analytics; allow Kaiko endpoint.
- XSS: Rely on React escaping; sanitize user-generated descriptions via DOMPurify; avoid raw HTML injection.
- Storage: Keep tokens in HttpOnly cookies; use localStorage only for non-sensitive preferences.

**Backend:**
- Input validation via Pydantic schemas + custom graph validator.
- Rate limiting with Envoy sidecar + Redis token bucket for mutation endpoints.
- CORS locked to Vercel domains per environment with strict methods/headers.

**Authentication:**
- Supabase access tokens limited to 60 minutes with silent refresh via auth helpers; store refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies.
- Stream Supabase `auth.audit_log_events` into Datadog for anomaly detection and alerting.
- Enforce password and MFA policies through Supabase (min length ≥12, breached password checks, email domain allowlist).

### Performance Optimization
**Frontend:**
- Initial JS bundle target <250 KB for authenticated shell.
- Stream onboarding/backtest panels using React Server Components + Suspense.
- Cache API responses via React Query (stale-while-revalidate) and CDN for marketing pages.

**Backend:**
- P95 API latency target <150 ms; asynchronous DB driver (asyncpg) with connection pooling.
- Timescale compression + partial indexes on `status`, `owner_id`, and `created_at`.
- Redis caching for hot template metadata and comparison aggregates.

  }
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /run backtest/i }).click();
  await expect(page.getByText(/upgrade to unlock more backtests/i)).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Coding Standards

### Critical Fullstack Rules
- **Shared contracts only:** Define request/response types in `packages/shared` and consume via generated clients—no ad-hoc interfaces.
- **Async everywhere:** Never block FastAPI or Next.js handlers; move CPU-heavy analytics into Celery workers.
- **Feature gates:** Use the central `FeatureGate` helper; do not hard-code role checks in components or routes.
- **Compliance hooks:** Any template visibility change must call `compliance_service.audit_change` before persistence.
- **Observability:** Wrap external API calls with the `with_tracing` decorator to capture spans + correlation IDs.

### Naming Conventions
| Element | Frontend | Backend | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Components | PascalCase | - | `StrategyCanvas.tsx` |
| Hooks | camelCase with `use` | - | `useBacktestStatus.ts` |
| API Routes | - | kebab-case | `/api/v1/paper-trades` |
| Database Tables | - | snake_case | `paper_trade_runs` |

### Error Response Format
```typescript
interface ApiError {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

### Frontend Error Handling
```typescript
export class ApiError extends Error {
  public readonly code: string;
  public readonly details?: Record<string, unknown>;

  private constructor(code: string, message: string, details?: Record<string, unknown>) {
    super(message);
    this.code = code;
    this.details = details;
  }

  static fromResponse(payload: ApiError, status: number) {
    const { code, message, details } = payload.error;
    return new ApiError(code, message, { ...details, status });
  }
}

export function interpretError(error: unknown): { title: string; description: string } {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    switch (error.code) {
      case 'quota_exceeded':
        return { title: 'Quota reached', description: 'Upgrade to unlock more backtests today.' };
      case 'validation_failed':
        return { title: 'Validation failed', description: 'Fix highlighted blocks and retry.' };
      default:
        return { title: 'Unexpected error', description: error.message };
    }
  }
  return { title: 'Network error', description: 'Check your connection and try again.' };
}
```

### Backend Error Handling
```python
from fastapi import Request, status
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from app.core.logging import logger
from app.core.errors import DomainError

async def domain_error_handler(request: Request, exc: DomainError) -> JSONResponse:
    logger.warning(
        'domain_error',
        extra={
            'code': exc.code,
            'details': exc.details,
            'request_id': request.state.request_id,
        },
    )
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code or status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
        content={
            'error': {
                'code': exc.code,
                'message': exc.message,
                'details': exc.details,
                'timestamp': request.state.timestamp.isoformat(),
                'requestId': request.state.request_id,
            }
        },
    )
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Monitoring Stack
- **Frontend:** Vercel Analytics + Sentry browser SDK with release tags and session replay for core flows.
- **Backend:** Datadog APM (FastAPI, Celery, Timescale) via OpenTelemetry exporters.
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry (frontend + backend) with Slack pager integration.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Datadog RUM, synthetic API checks, Timescale continuous aggregates for run durations.

### Key Metrics
**Frontend:** Core Web Vitals, JS error rate, API latency (React Query), guided onboarding completion.

**Backend:** Request rate, error rate, P95 latency, worker throughput, Redis queue depth, Timescale query performance.
