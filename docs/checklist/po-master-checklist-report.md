# PO Master Checklist Review – Blockbuilders

**Documents Reviewed:** `docs/architecture.md` (v0.4), `docs/prd.md` (v1.5), `docs/brief.md` (v1.1), `docs/front-end-spec.md` (v0.2)
**Reviewer:** Product Owner (PO)
**Date:** 2025-09-22
**Project Type:** Greenfield with full UI scope

## Executive Summary
- Checklist completion: **86%** (89 of 103 items PASS/APPROVED); recommendation **CONDITIONAL** pending developer bootstrap guidance and asset optimization workflow.
- Strengths: Operational ownership, credential playbooks, and backup cadences now thoroughly documented (`docs/prd.md:211`, `docs/architecture.md:1265`, `docs/prd.md:227`).
- Critical gaps: Engineer onboarding lacks README/bootstrap checklist, and UI spec still omits asset optimization + component handoff process (`docs/prd.md:201`, `docs/front-end-spec.md`).
- UI/UX alignment remains strong with accessibility and flow coverage, but build pipeline for assets needs definition before sprint kickoff.
- Recommendation: Close the two open items this week and re-run checklist to confirm full readiness.

## Category Analysis
| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | ⚠️ PARTIAL | No explicit README/bootstrap procedure for engineers (`docs/prd.md:201`). |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | ✅ PASS |  |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | ✅ PASS |  |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Missing asset optimization and UI handoff workflow (`docs/front-end-spec.md`). |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | ✅ PASS |  |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | ✅ PASS |  |
| 7. Risk Management (Brownfield) | N/A | Greenfield project. |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | ✅ PASS |  |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | ✅ PASS |  |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | ✅ PASS |  |

## Top Issues by Priority
### Blockers (Must Resolve Before Development)
- None identified; previous operational blockers cleared.

### High Priority
1. Define frontend asset optimization strategy (image handling, bundling, Storybook/component workflow) and document it in the UI spec or architecture runbooks (`docs/front-end-spec.md`).
2. Add an engineer-facing bootstrap/README checklist covering repository clone, dependency installation, environment variables, and common pitfalls (`docs/prd.md:201`).

### Medium Priority
1. Schedule first backup restore drill and capture results in the reliability register referenced in `ops/playbooks/` (`docs/prd.md:230`, `docs/architecture.md:1285`).
2. Confirm automation for rotation reminders is configured (Slack or calendar) and reference location in ops tracker (`docs/prd.md:221`, `docs/architecture.md:1277`).

### Low Priority
1. Capture roadmap notes for educator analytics extensions to ensure deferred scope stays visible (`docs/prd.md:160`).
2. Provide quick links to new playbooks from the main ops onboarding doc once created (`docs/architecture.md:1271`).

## Section Summaries
- **Project Setup & Initialization:** Epic scaffolding remains sound, but there is still no hands-on README/bootstrap walkthrough to unblock new engineers (`docs/prd.md:229`, `docs/prd.md:201`).
- **Infrastructure & Deployment:** Runbooks, rollback paths, and on-call plans fully articulated, including knowledge-transfer packet requirements (`docs/prd.md:203`, `docs/prd.md:233`, `docs/architecture.md:1288`).
- **External Dependencies:** Comprehensive provisioning playbook now lists owners, cadence, and storage of credentials across Supabase, AWS, Stripe, and data vendors (`docs/prd.md:211`, `docs/architecture.md:1265`).
- **UI/UX Considerations:** Flows and accessibility meet expectations, yet asset optimization and component delivery remain undefined (`docs/front-end-spec.md`).
- **User/Agent Responsibility:** Responsibility matrix clearly delineates human vs automation duties across compliance, credentials, backups, and support (`docs/prd.md:218`, `docs/architecture.md:1274`).
- **Documentation & Handoff:** Sprint 0 knowledge-transfer packet, ops log, and education suite mandates close prior gaps (`docs/prd.md:233`, `docs/architecture.md:1288`).

## Risk & Readiness Snapshot
- **Overall Readiness:** 86% PASS rate → **CONDITIONAL** go/no-go.
- **Developer Clarity Score:** 8/10. Technical pathways well-documented; missing bootstrap guide is the main friction.
- **Top Risks:** (1) Engineer onboarding delays without bootstrap instructions, (2) Frontend performance regressions from undefined asset strategy, (3) Runbook adoption lag if playbooks aren’t surfaced in ops onboarding.

## Recommendations
1. Draft a monorepo bootstrap README section with clone steps, dependency matrix (pnpm, Poetry), environment variable template, and troubleshooting notes (`docs/prd.md:201`).
2. Extend the UI spec with asset optimization and component delivery workflow covering build tooling, Storybook or equivalent, and QA checkpoints (`docs/front-end-spec.md`).
3. Populate `ops/playbooks/backup-restore.md` with the first scheduled drill, logging outcomes and remediation plans (`docs/architecture.md:1285`).
4. Link newly created playbooks and responsibility matrix into the team onboarding portal to ensure discoverability (`docs/architecture.md:1271`, `docs/prd.md:218`).

## Final Decision
**CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** – Proceed once bootstrap documentation and UI asset workflow are documented and linked. Notify PO for swift re-review after remediation.
