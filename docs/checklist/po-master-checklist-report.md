# PO Master Checklist Review – Blockbuilders

**Documents Reviewed:** `docs/architecture.md` (v0.3), `docs/prd.md` (v1.4), `docs/brief.md` (v1.1), `docs/front-end-spec.md` (v0.2)
**Reviewer:** Product Owner (PO)
**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Project Type:** Greenfield with full UI scope

## Executive Summary
- Checklist completion: **74%** (76 of 103 items PASS/APPROVED); recommendation **CONDITIONAL** pending operational playbooks and ownership matrices.
- Strengths: Monorepo scaffolding, CI/CD workflow, and epic sequencing are clearly defined (`docs/prd.md:229`, `docs/architecture.md:1129`, `docs/architecture.md:1210`).
- Critical gaps: No playbooks for third-party account provisioning, user vs. agent responsibility split, or knowledge-transfer/backup execution despite PRD guardrails (`docs/prd.md:86-108`).
- UI/UX guidance is mature and aligns with accessibility goals (`docs/front-end-spec.md:20-118`), yet asset optimization and documentation handoff remain undefined.
- Recommendation: Address the three blockers before sprint kickoff; proceed once playbooks and ownership docs are in place.

## Category Analysis
| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Missing README/bootstrap instructions and dependency conflict notes (`docs/prd.md:201`). |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | ✅ PASS | Middleware/dependency sequencing mostly covered; minor provider playbook gap. |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | ❌ FAIL | No documented account provisioning steps or credential rotation plan (`docs/prd.md:96`). |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Asset optimization & component workflow not documented (`docs/front-end-spec.md:20-120`). |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | ❌ FAIL | No RACI or owner mapping for human-only tasks (PRD lacks assignments). |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | ✅ PASS | Epics and stories sequenced logically (`docs/prd.md:229-340`). |
| 7. Risk Management (Brownfield) | N/A | Greenfield project; section skipped. |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | ✅ PASS | MVP boundaries explicit with deferred enhancements (`docs/prd.md:109-123`). |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Missing support runbooks, user help authoring, and knowledge transfer plans. |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | ✅ PASS | Roadmap and extensibility notes present (`docs/prd.md:109-123`). |

## Top Issues by Priority
### Blockers (Must Resolve Before Development)
1. Document cloud/SaaS account provisioning and credential management for Supabase, AWS, Stripe, and market data vendors (lacking in `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`).
2. Establish user vs. agent responsibility matrix covering compliance reviews, credential upkeep, and support actions.
3. Translate PRD backup/retention requirements into an executable plan (tooling, cadence, owners) (`docs/prd.md:86-108`).

### High Priority
1. Produce deployment/support knowledge-transfer artifacts (release process, on-call expectations) before Sprint 0 kickoff.
2. Define user-facing documentation and education deliverables to satisfy onboarding and trust KPIs (`docs/prd.md:129-160`).

### Medium Priority
1. Add README bootstrap checklist for engineers, including dependency conflict mitigation (`docs/prd.md:201`).
2. Document frontend asset optimization strategy (images, bundling, Storybook or equivalent) to support UX, reduce regressions.
3. Clarify fallback plans for external infrastructure services (DNS, email/SMS) referenced in architecture diagrams (`docs/architecture.md:23-57`).

### Low Priority
1. Note configuration for template seeding/initial data to accelerate onboarding flows.
2. Capture roadmap hooks for future educator analytics to avoid MVP bleed (`docs/prd.md:121`).

## Section Summaries
- **Project Setup & Initialization:** Epic 1 provides strong scaffolding, but repository bootstrap and dependency guidance are thin (`docs/prd.md:229`, `docs/prd.md:201`).
- **Infrastructure & Deployment:** CI/CD and environment definitions are comprehensive (`docs/architecture.md:1200-1263`). Playbooks for provisioning tools remain open.
- **External Dependencies:** Integrations described, yet operational ownership for accounts, keys, and rotations absent (`docs/prd.md:96`).
- **UI/UX Considerations:** UX spec covers flows and accessibility; need workflows for asset handling and component development.
- **User/Agent Responsibility:** No assignments for human-only actions (e.g., compliance audits, support SLAs) despite PRD guardrails, leaving accountability unclear.
- **Documentation & Handoff:** Support SLAs set in PRD (`docs/prd.md:198-214`) but knowledge transfer steps, user help docs, and runbooks are missing.

## Risk & Readiness Snapshot
- **Overall Readiness:** 74% PASS rate → **CONDITIONAL** go/no-go.
- **Developer Clarity Score:** 7/10. Technical paths clear; operational ambiguities (accounts, handoffs) persist.
- **Top Risks:** (1) Operational blockers from missing account playbooks, (2) Compliance failure due to undefined human responsibilities, (3) Data protection breach from unimplemented backup plans.

## Recommendations
1. Create a third-party account provisioning guide with owners, tooling, and rotation cadences covering Supabase, AWS, Stripe, and data vendors.
2. Produce a responsibility matrix detailing which tasks belong to human operators vs. developer agents; include compliance reviews, credential management, and support workflows.
3. Draft backup/restore and DR playbook aligned with PRD retention mandates, naming tooling, cadence, and validation schedule.
4. Add README/bootstrap instructions plus dependency conflict guidance to unblock engineers on day one (`docs/prd.md:201`).
5. Define frontend asset optimization and component development workflow (e.g., design tokens to Tailwind, testing strategy) consistent with UX spec expectations.
6. Outline knowledge transfer artifacts for deployment operations, support SLAs, and user-facing documentation to close handoff gaps.

## Final Decision
**CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** – Ready to proceed once blockers (account provisioning, responsibility matrix, backup/DR plan) and high-priority handoffs are delivered. Notify PO for re-review after remediations are documented.
