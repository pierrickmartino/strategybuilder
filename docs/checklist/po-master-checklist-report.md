# PO Master Checklist Review – Blockbuilders

**Documents Reviewed:** `docs/architecture.md` (v0.4), `docs/prd.md` (v1.5), `docs/brief.md` (v1.1), `docs/front-end-spec.md` (v0.3)
**Reviewer:** Product Owner (PO)
**Date:** 2025-09-23
**Project Type:** Greenfield with full UI scope

## Executive Summary
- Checklist completion: **100%** (104 of 104 applicable items PASS); recommendation **APPROVED** with zero blocking issues.
- Engineer bootstrap workflow now prescribes prerequisites, environment variables, smoke tests, and documentation hooks, giving developers a complete starting point (`docs/prd.md:199`).
- UI spec adds asset optimization, bundling budgets, Storybook gates, and QA expectations that align implementation with performance and accessibility targets (`docs/front-end-spec.md:273`).
- Architecture playbooks capture platform topology, credential ownership, backup cadence, and human vs. automation responsibilities to de-risk operations (`docs/architecture.md:20`, `docs/architecture.md:1265`).
- Sections skipped: **7. Risk Management (Brownfield)** (project is greenfield).

## Top Issues by Priority
### Blockers (Must Resolve Before Development)
- None – all checklist requirements satisfied.

### High Priority
- None.

### Medium Priority (Track During Sprint 0)
- Stand up the visual regression script referenced in the Storybook workflow so QA automation meets the documented expectation (`docs/front-end-spec.md:286`).
- Create the `ops/playbooks/` repository stub the architecture doc references to host credential, backup, and restore logs before handover (`docs/architecture.md:1271`).

### Low Priority / Watchlist
- Keep Chromatic approval and Storybook MDX documentation tied to the design system backlog as the UI kit lands (`docs/front-end-spec.md:286`).
- Capture outcomes of the scheduled backup restore drills in the reliability register once operations begin (`docs/architecture.md:1285`).

## Section Summaries
- **Project Setup & Initialization:** Epic 1 stories bundle monorepo scaffolding, authentication, onboarding, and sample data, while the bootstrap checklist covers cloning, env setup, and smoke validation (`docs/prd.md:295`, `docs/prd.md:199`).
- **Infrastructure & Deployment:** Architecture specifies platform topology, IaC targets, CI/CD pipeline, environment matrix, and rollback procedures across frontend and backend (`docs/architecture.md:20`, `docs/architecture.md:1245`).
- **External Dependencies & Integrations:** Credential owners, rotation cadences, and vendor redundancy are defined for Supabase, AWS, Stripe, and market data partners with automation hooks (`docs/architecture.md:1265`).
- **UI/UX Considerations:** Spec documents flows, accessibility, responsive adaptations, asset optimization, bundling budgets, and Storybook handoff/QA gates, enabling consistent implementation (`docs/front-end-spec.md:245`, `docs/front-end-spec.md:273`).
- **User/Agent Responsibility:** Responsibility matrix clarifies human versus automated duties for disclosures, credential audits, backups, and support escalation, keeping accountability explicit (`docs/architecture.md:1273`).
- **MVP Scope Alignment:** PRD enumerates MVP must-haves, deferred features, and KPIs, ensuring scope discipline and measurable activation targets (`docs/prd.md:109`).
- **Documentation & Handoff:** Runbooks, knowledge-transfer packets, support expectations, and onboarding artefacts are mandated prior to beta, locking in operational readiness (`docs/architecture.md:1288`).
- **Post-MVP Planning:** Deferred enhancements and roadmap phases are mapped so future growth (educator dashboards, insight engine, marketplace) stays visible without derailing MVP delivery (`docs/prd.md:124`).

## Risk & Readiness Snapshot
- **Overall Readiness:** 100% checklist pass rate → **APPROVED** go/no-go. No critical blockers remain.
- **Developer Clarity Score:** 9/10 – tasks, dependencies, and guardrails are explicit; only pending automation scripts need scheduling.
- **Top Risks:** Regulatory perception, data quality, simulation realism, infrastructure cost spikes, and user overwhelm with advanced options (`docs/brief.md:130`).
- **Mitigation Outlook:** Active risk register tracks vendor selection, slippage modelling, and freemium quota definition with owners and target dates (`docs/brief.md:137`).

## Recommendations
- **Must-Fix Before Kickoff:** None.
- **Should-Fix Soon:**
  1. Implement the promised visual regression command and Chromatic gating alongside Storybook setup to keep UI QA automated (`docs/front-end-spec.md:286`).
  2. Add an `ops/playbooks/README.md` seed so backup and credential procedures have an owned home when sprint execution begins (`docs/architecture.md:1271`).
- **Consider For Improvement:**
  1. Link the new bootstrap checklist from the root README to increase discoverability for incoming engineers (`docs/prd.md:203`).
  2. Integrate risk register updates into weekly product syncs so mitigation status stays transparent (`docs/brief.md:137`).
- **Post-MVP Deferrals:** Continue grooming educator analytics, insight engine, and marketplace enhancements per roadmap phases once MVP KPIs are stable (`docs/prd.md:124`).

## Final Decision
**APPROVED** – Documentation now meets PO master checklist standards. Proceed with Sprint 0 execution while tracking the medium-priority follow-ups above.
