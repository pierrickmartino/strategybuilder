# PM Checklist Review – Blockbuilders (Follow-up)

**Documents Reviewed:** `docs/prd.md` (v1.4) and `docs/brief.md` (v1.1)
**Reviewer:** Product Manager (PM)
**Date:** 2025-09-21

## Executive Summary
- PRD completeness ≈95%; checklist coverage improved with research tracker and operational playbook additions.
- MVP scope remains **Just Right**; activation-to-trust loop intact without unnecessary scope creep.
- Ready for architecture phase with follow-up on research synthesis and risk tracking cadence.
- Critical gap: upcoming interviews and competitive teardown still need synthesized insights embedded once completed.

## Category Analysis
| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem Definition & Context | **PASS** | Await integration of scheduled interview insights to solidify evidence base. |
| MVP Scope Definition | **PASS** | |
| User Experience Requirements | **PASS** | |
| Functional Requirements | **PASS** | |
| Non-Functional Requirements | **PASS** | |
| Epic & Story Structure | **PASS** | |
| Technical Guidance | **PASS** | |
| Cross-Functional Requirements | **PASS** | |
| Clarity & Communication | **PASS** | |

## Top Issues by Priority
### Blockers
- None; documents are architecture-ready while follow-ups progress.

### High Priority
1. Synthesize user interviews and competitive analysis into the research sections once sessions conclude (`docs/prd.md:26-37`, `docs/brief.md:30-47`).

### Medium Priority
1. Keep beta operations log, release notes, and on-call expectations active as engineering work begins (`docs/prd.md:198-214`).
2. Review and update risk register owners/dates during stakeholder syncs (`docs/brief.md:136-141`).

### Low Priority
1. Add UX/architecture diagram references when assets are produced to aid future readers (`docs/prd.md:360-386`).

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Potential Trims:** Educator analytics enhancements, automated insight engine, advanced premium analytics stay deferred (`docs/prd.md:108-123`).
- **Missing Essentials:** None; core canvas→backtest→paper trading loop is thoroughly defined.
- **Complexity Concerns:** Parallel delivery of data vendor validation, simulation fidelity, and quota modeling requires close coordination but owners/dates are now explicit (`docs/prd.md:216-221`).
- **Timeline Realism:** Remains feasible with staged releases and risk monitoring; twice-weekly staging cadence defined.

## Technical Readiness
- Architecture direction, deployment cadence, runbooks, and support SLAs are specified (`docs/prd.md:198-214`).
- Risk register updated with owners/status/timing across data, simulation, cost guardrails, quotas, and compliance (`docs/prd.md:216-221`).
- Beta operations discipline (release notes, incident log, stakeholder sync cadence) documented; awaiting execution.

## Recommendations
1. Publish interview & benchmarking syntheses per committed dates and feed results into PRD/brief evidence sections (`docs/prd.md:33-37`).
2. Initialize beta operations log and release-note workflow before first staging promotion to enforce runbook discipline (`docs/prd.md:208-214`).
3. Maintain risk register reviews in fortnightly stakeholder syncs to ensure owners deliver mitigation plans (`docs/brief.md:136-141`).

## Final Decision
**READY FOR ARCHITECT – WITH FOLLOW-UPS**: Clear for architecture handoff with ongoing monitoring of research synthesis and operational readiness tasks.
