# PM Checklist Review – Blockbuilders

**Documents Reviewed:** `docs/prd.md` (v1.3) and `docs/brief.md` (v1.0)
**Reviewer:** Product Manager (PM)
**Date:** 2025-09-20

## Executive Summary
- PRD completeness ≈89%; most checklist areas are addressed with only research synthesis and implementation guidance still light.
- MVP scope feels **Just Right**, but simultaneous delivery of canvas, backtests, paper trading, and billing warrants sequencing discipline.
- Readiness for architecture phase: **Ready with caveats** pending research inputs and operational playbook additions.
- Critical gaps: scheduled (not yet synthesized) research/competitive analysis and missing deployment/support expectations.

## Category Analysis
| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem Definition & Context | **PARTIAL** | Research findings not yet captured; competitive insights pending interviews leaving validation assumptions open.
| MVP Scope Definition | **PASS** |  |
| User Experience Requirements | **PASS** |  |
| Functional Requirements | **PASS** |  |
| Non-Functional Requirements | **PASS** |  |
| Epic & Story Structure | **PASS** |  |
| Technical Guidance | **PARTIAL** | Implementation/deployment expectations and support processes remain implicit.
| Cross-Functional Requirements | **PASS** |  |
| Clarity & Communication | **PASS** |  |

## Top Issues by Priority
### Blockers
- None identified; document can move forward once high-priority items are addressed.

### High Priority
1. Incorporate synthesized user interviews/competitive benchmarking once available so assumptions are evidence-backed.
2. Add implementation guidance covering deployment cadence, runbooks, support expectations, and documentation deliverables before engineering kickoff.

### Medium Priority
1. Track data-vendor selection, simulation realism validation, and freemium quota definition risks with clear owners/dates so they feed the architecture track.
2. Confirm earlier “Needs Refinement” checklist version is superseded by this review to prevent process confusion.

### Low Priority
1. Consider appending diagram references or placeholder callouts to prep for UX/architecture attachments without bloating the document today.

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Potential Trims:** If timeline slips, educator governance analytics and comparison enhancements are the first candidates to defer.
- **Missing Essentials:** None observed; activation/backtest/paper trading loop is represented.
- **Complexity Concerns:** Delivering canvas, simulations, paper trading, and billing in parallel will test the 16-week beta plan—ensure cross-team sequencing.
- **Timeline Realism:** Achievable with parallel workstreams and early risk burndown; monitor for dependency collisions.

## Technical Readiness
- Stack, observability, and infrastructure direction are clear; risks around data vendor contracts, simulation fidelity, and cost guardrails are logged but need action plans.
- Testing expectations (unit→E2E) are defined, yet deployment/rollback procedures and documentation responsibilities should be recorded for engineering and support alignment.

## Recommendations
1. Synthesize upcoming interview/competitive insights into the PRD’s research subsection once sessions conclude.
2. Draft a lightweight implementation playbook (deployment cadence, rollback, runbooks, support SLAs) within the Technical Guidance or Operational Guardrails sections.
3. Establish an explicit risk register entry for data vendor selection, simulation realism, and freemium quotas with owners and due dates.
4. Update the change log to reflect this checklist execution and clarify that previous “Needs Refinement” status has been resolved.

## Final Decision
**READY FOR ARCHITECT – WITH FOLLOW-UPS**: Clear to proceed while closing the high-priority items above in parallel.

## Next Steps
1. Incorporate research outcomes and competitive analysis into the PRD when available.
2. Add implementation/runbook guidance to Technical Guidance/Operational Guardrails sections.
3. Confirm ownership and timelines for open risks (data vendor, simulation fidelity, freemium quotas).
4. Reconfirm checklist status with stakeholders after updates to maintain alignment.
