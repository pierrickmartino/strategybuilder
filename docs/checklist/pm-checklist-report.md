# PM Checklist Review – Blockbuilders (2025-09-20)

## Executive Summary
- Documentation completeness is roughly **70%**: strong functional coverage, but critical cross-functional and validation gaps remain.
- MVP scope is currently **Too Large**; requires trimming or phased release before entering build.
- Readiness for architecture is **Nearly Ready**, contingent on documenting technical/cross-functional guidance and MVP validation plan.
- Most urgent issues: absent data/integration/ops requirements, undefined MVP validation approach, and pending user research evidence.

## Category Analysis

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PARTIAL | Research evidence and quantified impact still pending (`docs/brief.md:132-147`). |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PARTIAL | No out-of-scope list or validation strategy captured in PRD (`docs/prd.md:20-245`). |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PARTIAL | UX section lists paradigms but lacks full flows, error states, accessibility checkpoints (`docs/prd.md:43-170`). |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | — |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | — |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | — |
| 7. Technical Guidance | FAIL | No platform constraints, technical feasibility notes, or integration architecture (`docs/prd.md:246-255`). |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | FAIL | Data entities, integrations, and operational expectations absent (`docs/prd.md:20-245`). |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PASS | — |

## Top Issues by Priority
- **BLOCKER** – Document cross-functional requirements: capture data schema/retention, integration touchpoints (market data, Stripe, notifications), and operational guardrails so downstream teams have scope (`docs/prd.md:20-245`).
- **HIGH** – Define MVP boundaries and validation plan: add explicit out-of-scope items, future phases, and MVP success/feedback loops tied to KPIs (`docs/prd.md:20-245`).
- **HIGH** – Provide user research evidence or flag as open action with owners/dates to prevent assumptions from hardening (`docs/brief.md:132-147`).
- **MEDIUM** – Expand UX requirements with primary flows, decision points, edge cases, and accessibility acceptance criteria to guide design/dev (`docs/prd.md:43-170`).
- **MEDIUM** – Integrate key business metrics from the brief into the PRD for single-source traceability and future measurement alignment (`docs/prd.md:5-10`, `docs/brief.md:30-45`).

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Trim candidates:** educator/cohort monitoring tools, advanced insight engine, premium entitlement workflows—defer to post-MVP to protect timeline (`docs/prd.md:161-245`).
- **Missing essentials:** onboarding telemetry and version rollback requirements implied but not scoped; ensure baseline coverage before cut decisions (`docs/prd.md:22-31`).
- **Complexity:** four epics with rich acceptance criteria exceed the 16-week beta unless staged; consider sequencing by learning impact (`docs/brief.md:30-34`).
- **Timeline risk:** Without an articulated validation plan and scoped feedback loops, learning milestones could slip, jeopardizing beta goals.

## Technical Readiness
- No documented technical constraints, integration architecture, or feasibility notes; architects lack guidance beyond the prompt (`docs/prd.md:246-255`).
- Risks include unconfirmed market data vendors, compliance automation, Stripe integration, and cost guardrails (`docs/brief.md:144-146`, `docs/prd.md:137-170`).
- Recommend enumerating areas needing technical investigation (simulation worker scaling, entitlement enforcement, observability stack) before architect kickoff.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. Add cross-functional requirements section covering data, integrations, ops/support, and monitoring expectations.
2. Define MVP boundaries, future enhancements, and validation/feedback plan tied to success metrics.
3. Capture current user research findings or explicitly document pending research with owners/dates.
4. Extend UX section with canonical flows, edge cases, and accessibility checkpoints; link to forthcoming UX artifacts.
5. Fold key business metrics from the brief into the PRD and update the checklist results section once gaps are addressed.

## Final Decision
**NEEDS REFINEMENT** – Address blockers before handing off to architecture.
