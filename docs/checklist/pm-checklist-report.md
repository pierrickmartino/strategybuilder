# PM Checklist Review – Blockbuilders (2025-09-20)

## Executive Summary
- Overall completeness estimated at **~85%**; documentation demonstrates strong alignment across goals, requirements, and epics but several gaps prevent final approval.
- MVP scope remains **"Just Right"** thanks to clear core/out-of-scope delineation, yet stakeholder readiness is undermined by outstanding research placeholders and conflicting identity provider choices.
- Architecture readiness is **"Nearly Ready"** pending resolution of the auth-provider mismatch and formal logging of the PM checklist results.
- Critical next actions: reconcile Supabase vs Auth0 guidance, replace TBD market-sizing reference with live data, capture completed research inputs, and expand UX flows for key journeys.

## Category Analysis

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PARTIAL | Market-sizing reference still TBD and research evidence remains prospective (`docs/brief.md:138-140`). |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PASS | — |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PARTIAL | PRD enumerates key screens but lacks end-to-end flow and edge-case coverage for onboarding/backtesting (`docs/prd.md:55-70`). |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | — |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | — |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | — |
| 7. Technical Guidance | PARTIAL | Auth provider conflict (Supabase vs Auth0) introduces cross-document drift (`docs/prd.md:84-89`). |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data retention/support expectations not articulated; integration details high-level only (`docs/prd.md:84-96`). |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PARTIAL | Brief still marked "Draft v0.1" and PM checklist results not appended (`docs/brief.md:3`, `docs/prd.md:246`). |

## Top Issues by Priority

- **BLOCKER** – Resolve identity-provider conflict: PRD specifies Supabase authentication while architecture and strategy rely on Auth0. Pick one stack (or justify dual usage) and update both documents with rationale and change-log entries (`docs/prd.md:84-89`, `docs/architecture.md:18-70`).
- **HIGH** – Replace TBD research artifacts: supply the market-sizing spreadsheet link or remove until available; document any completed research synthesis to avoid perception of missing inputs (`docs/brief.md:125-140`).
- **HIGH** – Enrich user research evidence: personas reference planned interviews but lack summarized findings; add insights or flag as an explicit follow-up with owner/date.
- **MEDIUM** – Extend UX flow coverage: capture critical path steps, decision points, and edge cases for onboarding → first backtest and template iteration flows to guide development (`docs/prd.md:55-70`).
- **MEDIUM** – Define operational guardrails: add data retention/support expectations plus integration validation plans for market data, billing, and notifications (`docs/prd.md:84-96`).

## MVP Scope Assessment
- Current must-haves align with the core problem; comparison exports could be deferred if timelines tighten, provided learning goals are preserved.
- Ensure MVP success criteria tie to measurable baselines (e.g., current activation rates) so future validation is rigorous.
- Complexity appears manageable, but confirm that template comparison features do not overreach MVP bandwidth.

## Technical Readiness
- Clarify identity provider, billing stack, and hosting split to maintain alignment with architecture; document rationale in change logs once settled.
- Flag pending data-governance tasks (retention, backups, compliance logs) for architect follow-up.
- Highlight any areas requiring technical spikes (e.g., market data vendor selection, quota enforcement) so architecture can plan investigation.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. Align PRD and architecture on auth, billing, and infrastructure selections; update change logs after reconciliation.
2. Publish or link finalized market sizing and early research outputs; if still pending, identify owners and due dates in both brief and PRD.
3. Add detailed user flows (onboarding to first backtest, template clone to comparison) with edge cases and decision points.
4. Document data retention, support expectations, and integration testing approach within the PRD to close cross-functional gaps.
5. Once updates land, rerun the PM checklist and log results inside `docs/prd.md:246` to mark formal sign-off readiness.
