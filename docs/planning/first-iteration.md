# First Iteration Plan

## Overview

The first iteration focuses on introducing the product vision with a compelling landing page in the Next.js frontend. The goal is to communicate the core value proposition and freemium model without implementing backend integrations yet.

## Deliverables

- Replace the default homepage at `frontend/app/page.tsx` with a static "coming soon" experience that aligns with the PRD.
- Craft a hero section that explains how the platform empowers users to build crypto trading strategies visually and risk-free.
- Add a three-card "How it works" section covering visual design, safe validation, and live paper trading.
- Include a freemium comparison block that outlines Free vs Premium benefits to mirror the business model.
- Keep all content static for now to maintain a lightweight, easy-to-build iteration.

## Rationale

This iteration establishes messaging and design direction while remaining simple to implement. It lays the foundation for future additions such as authentication, strategy builder interactions, and backend connectivity.
