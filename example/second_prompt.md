On user persona details, I think these entrepreneurs are particularly digitally proficient. The selling point of this app is that it's not just another generic posting platformâ€”it gives users the power to change their templates and properties. We're targeting more of a power user market. While others might use Buffer or Hootsuite, this is really for entrepreneurs who want to fine-tune their language, voice, and edit their own properties.

In terms of design, I prefer making things as minimalistic as possible. However, since users need options to change templates and customize settings, a balanced approach makes sense. Regarding branding and color preferences, I'll defer to your judgment based on our target market. Since we're targeting the development community and solopreneur makers, dark mode will likely be popular. For accessibility, we'll offer a light mode option as well, so our color scheme needs to accommodate both.

For devices, we're taking a desktop-first approach, but the app should be mobile responsive so users can operate it on phones and tablets. This will also inform our future React Native application development.
