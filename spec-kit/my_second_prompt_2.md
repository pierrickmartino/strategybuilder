On user persona details, I think these entrepreneurs are mostly self-learners tinkering at home. The selling point of this app is that it's not just another over-complex platformâ€”it gives crypto traders the power to build their strategies with no code. We're targeting more of a lambda traders who know how to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but do not know when and want to optimise their trading strategy. While others (institutions and professionals) may use TradingView or Python development, this tool is really aimed at entrepreneurs who want to refine their strategy in the simplest way possible.

In terms of design, I prefer making things as minimalistic as possible. However, since users need options to change strategies and customize settings, a balanced approach makes sense. Regarding branding and color preferences, I'll defer to your judgment based on our target market. Since we're targeting the development community and solopreneur makers, dark mode will likely be popular. For accessibility, we'll offer a light mode option as well, so our color scheme needs to accommodate both.

For devices, we're taking a desktop-first approach, but the app should be mobile responsive so users can operate it on phones and tablets. This will also inform our future React Native application development.
