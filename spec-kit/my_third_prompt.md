I think that out of the three options, my preference is number two. Let's add the orange accent colour and... I'd like to have the option to switch to light mode. For accessibility reasons, of course. I'd like the main navigation to be in the top bar, which can be minimised. This will allow you to create a new strategy. It will display all recent strategies. It will include settings and a link to a template. And every time you navigate through the top menu, these components will open in the main content area, and at the right of the menu bar, the person's profile icon will be displayed. Clicking on it will allow them to log out.
