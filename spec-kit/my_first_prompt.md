Let me explain what Blockbuilders is. It’s a web app that lets non-coder retail crypto traders design, test, and monitor trading strategies without writing code. Instead of juggling spreadsheets, Pine Script, or opaque bots, you drag blocks onto a visual canvas—data sources, indicators, signals, risk controls, and execution—and connect them into a runnable strategy. The system validates your wiring in real time and versions your changes automatically. 

When you’re ready, you run fast backtests (targeting ~30 seconds for a year of hourly BTC/ETH data) to see equity curves, KPIs, and trade logs. From there, you can schedule paper-trading to observe live-like performance with notifications in-app and by email. A comparison view lets you line up multiple strategies side-by-side to spot what’s working. The app guides new users with starter templates, a short onboarding checklist, and contextual education so most people can achieve a first successful backtest within minutes. 

The initial audience is twofold: hands-on retail tinkerers trading on major exchanges who want trustworthy, reproducible workflows, and educators/community leaders who need shareable, governed templates for their cohorts. The MVP focuses on the strategy canvas, deterministic backtesting for BTC-USD and ETH-USD, a paper-trading scheduler with dashboards, and freemium limits with Stripe-powered upgrades. Advanced cohort analytics, automated insight engines, and deep premium analytics are explicitly deferred until after the core loop proves itself. 

Success is measured by quick activation and trust: new accounts completing onboarding and a first backtest, time-to-value under ~20 minutes, weekly backtest cadence per active user, strong adoption of paper-trading in week one, and an 8/10+ Net Trust Score—feeding a freemium model with clear upgrade paths. Operationally, the product emphasizes speed, reliability (99.5% uptime target in beta), encryption/auditability, and observability across data quality and execution. Compliance is woven throughout with clear “simulation-only / not financial advice” messaging. 

Under the hood, the team runs a monorepo with a Next.js frontend and FastAPI services, backed by TimescaleDB for market data and results. Workers handle simulations; queues decouple workloads; Stripe, Supabase, SendGrid, and Datadog/Sentry round out billing, auth, comms, and monitoring. The roadmap is organized into four epics: (1) foundation + guided canvas, (2) trusted data/backtesting, (3) paper trading + monitoring/alerts, and (4) community sharing + monetization with governance. Clear playbooks, provisioning checklists, and on-call/runbooks support beta operations. 

In short, Blockbuilders gives curious traders and educators a safeguarded, visual lab to go from idea → backtest → paper-trade—fast—while keeping results reproducible, explainable, and compliant.
